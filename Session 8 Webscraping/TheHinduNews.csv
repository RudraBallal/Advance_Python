In Chhattisgarh, the ruling Congress has built an election plank with a mix of regional pride and welfarism. The Bharatiya Janata Party, its principal opponent, is targeting the government on corruption and non-fulfilment of election promises made five years ago. The Congress’s attempts to build a narrative around Chhattisgarhi sub-nationalism have made regional identity a key electoral theme for the first time since the State was formed in 2000. The party is also relying on its direct benefit transfer schemes such as the Rajiv Gandhi Kisan Nyay Yojana or the Godhan Nyay Yojana, or higher prices on minor forest produce that cover a major chunk of the rural and tribal populace. Rural housing is another issue that has been hotly contested with both sides accusing the other of being ineffective and insensitive in this regard. A government survey that has pegged the share of Other Backward Classes (OBC) in the State’s population at 43.5% forms the backdrop to the Congress’s special focus on the social group. The BJP has fielded OBC representatives in nearly two-thirds of the general seats. In the 90-strong Assembly, 10 seats are reserved for Scheduled Castes and 29 for Scheduled Tribes. Nine of 13 candidates announced by the Congress for general seats are from OBCs. Both parties exhibit their commitment towards OBCs, and tribes people who form nearly a third of the population seem to get less attention.The BJP has accused the government of large-scale corruption. The Enforcement Directorate is conducting a multitude of probes that entangle bureaucrats and other individuals linked to the government or the Congress party, including Chief Minister Bhupesh Baghel’s close aides. The Congress dismisses these allegations and accuses the Centre of running a witch-hunt against it. By fielding the father of a young man who died in communal riots and another riot accused against the lone Muslim face of the Baghel cabinet, the BJP has indicated that it is aiming at polarisation. The party is facing disenchantment among its workers who complain that too many old faces have been fielded again. The Congress, in its first list of 30, has dropped eight sitting Members of the Legislative Assembly and can expect some rebellion in the ranks too. Both parties claim credit for the reduction in violence in the insurgency-hit Bastar region, but a new political entrant, the Hamar Raj party, is hoping to harness tribal discontent against both. A rejuvenated Aam Aadmi Party (AAP), the declining Janta Congress Chhattisgarh founded by the late Ajit Jogi, and the Bahujan Samaj Party are also in the fray, but the contest will likely remain between the Congress and the BJP.

From time immemorial, the Olympics has been used as a soft-power medium. Governments worldwide have bet on the sporting, economic and socio-cultural impact the games can leave, as well as on the political legitimacy the hosting of the event can bring. Post-World War Europe, post-apartheid South Africa and Brazil of the 2010s are vivid examples. Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s announcement at the International Olympic Committee (IOC) session in Mumbai that India “would leave no stone unturned” in its efforts to organise the 2036 edition of the quadrennial extravaganza is to be seen in this light. That India has also expressed an interest in the Youth Olympics as a precursor is a clear signal that it wants to shed the reticence that came with the unsavoury happenings at the scam-ridden and ineptly handled 2010 Delhi Commonwealth Games. Though the ratification of the host city for 2036 will take time — Brisbane was selected for the 2032 edition only in July 2021 — and there will be other claimants, the move lays bare India’s global ambitions. Be it through the desire for a permanent membership at the United Nations Security Council or the euphoria surrounding the G-20 presidency, India has consistently sought a seat at the high table. The tag of an Olympic host can give it a vantage position in a shifting world order.Sporting-wise, it is clear that India wants to benefit from the strong tailwind produced by the stellar 107-medal show at the recently concluded Asian Games. Ever since Abhinav Bindra won the nation’s first-ever individual Olympic gold at Beijing 2008, there has been a steady uptick in performances at multi-disciplinary competitions. There is even a firm belief that India will win double-digit medals at Paris 2024. While such confidence is not entirely misplaced, conducting a mega event such as the Olympics presents a humongous challenge. Costs are often prohibitive, as seen from the fierce public outcry during both Rio 2016 and Tokyo 2020. In the case of Tokyo, the financial burden was said to have ballooned to $15.4 billion, more than double the initial estimate. Recently, the Australian state of Victoria pulled out of hosting the 2026 Commonwealth Games because of mounting expenditure and the Canadian province of Alberta withdrew a bid for the 2030 edition. To avoid being seen as a populist ephemera in a deeply unequal society, the IOC has moved away from the one-size-fits-all solution and now asks potential organisers to present projects that best fit their economic, social and environmental realities. India’s success will depend on how it marries its aspirations with the inherent complexities.

Within hours of the massacre of Israeli citizens by Hamas fighters last Saturday, Prime Minister Narendra Modi tweeted India’s solidarity with Israel. While the histories of their conflicts and the scale of violence have been very different, India has faced terror attacks all too often to not feel the pain in Israel where teenagers at a concert, children in a park, grandparents at home, and even babies in cribs were gunned down, amidst other atrocities Hamas carried out, including taking dozens hostage. The sentiments were repeated when Mr. Modi spoke to Israel Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, condemning terrorism in all its forms. India’s second big concern has been the safety of its citizens, especially as Israel began retaliatory strikes on Gaza. Around 18,000 Indians work or study in Israel, in addition to about 85,000 Israelis of Indian origin (from Maharashtra, Manipur, Mizoram, Kerala, and West Bengal). The Ministry of External Affairs (MEA) has chartered flights to bring them home. New Delhi has also added nuance to the initial position, with the MEA delivering the government’s first formal statement. While repeating the condemnation of the Hamas attacks, the statement reminded Israel about the “universal obligation to observe international humanitarian law”, as it carries out “global responsibility to fight the menace of terrorism....” In addition, the MEA reiterated its “long-standing and consistent” position on the Palestine issue.The statement is a reminder of the tightrope India has walked since 1992, when New Delhi established full diplomatic ties with Israel, while continuing to support the Palestinian cause. There has been a shift towards Israel’s position, given increasingly close bilateral relations, trade, technological assistance, military procurement, and counter-terrorism cooperation. In 2017, Mr. Modi became the first Indian Prime Minister to visit Israel, while in 2018, Mr. Netanyahu visited India. However, Mr. Modi was also the first Indian Prime Minister to make an official visit to Palestine. In 2017, India voted against the U.S. and Israel for an attempt to declare unilaterally all of Jerusalem as the Israeli capital. The policy lines New Delhi is continuing to draw seem clear: to abhor terrorism, but not to condone indiscriminate reprisal bombings, even as it holds its consistent position on Palestine. No claim to righting historical grievances can possibly be used by Hamas to explain its inhuman attacks on Israel. However, a responsible state cannot behave like an insurgent group, and Israel’s latest demand, that more than a million Gaza residents must evacuate as it continues to pound the city and plans a possible ground offensive, will make Delhi’s challenge at balancing policy even more complex.

Mizoram, India’s second least populated State, where civil society predominates politics like, arguably, no other in the country, is poised to see a three-cornered battle in the Assembly elections scheduled in November. Unlike other States, Mizoram’s political contestation is less dependent on money and muscle power, as social service, public standing and the backing of religious and social organisations are key conditions for candidature. The ruling Mizo National Front has to contend not only with its traditional rival, the Indian National Congress, but also the Zoram Peoples’ Movement (ZPM), which has presented it a tough challenge this time. It is also facing desertion from its ranks with the Speaker, Lalrinliana Sailo, latching on to the Bharatiya Janata Party. Chief Minister Zoramthanga, a seasoned leader of the formerly insurgent MNF, has played the ethnic card to win support from the Mizo electorate. By championing the cause of the Kuki-Zo people, embroiled in an ethnic conflict in neighbouring Manipur and by ignoring a directive from the Union government to collect biometric data of refugees from Myanmar, citing their ethnic affinity with the Mizo people, Mr. Zoramthanga has tried to steal a march over his opponents. While all parties in Mizoram share the government’s and the ruling party’s view on this issue, the MNF’s vociferous positioning has given it an edge. During the peak of the conflict, civil society organisations managed demonstrations in solidarity with the Kuki-Zo people — an issue that has resonated with the Mizo electorate.The ZPM, meanwhile, has sought to harp on the MNF’s record on development and to leverage on its surprisingly good performance in the Lunglei Municipal Council polls, which indicate its enhanced urban base. In the rural areas, the strongest opposition to the MNF has emerged from the Congress, which is leading an alliance of parties, including the People’s Conference and the Zoram Nationalist Party. Inflation has remained a key concern in the State, even relative to the rest of India over the past year, and this could be one of the factors behind voter choice. Despite being a small State — 0.1% of India’s population and contributing close to 0.1% of the national GDP — Mizoram is a crucial border State with ample potential for economic growth led by the services and tourism sectors despite being a largely agrarian economy. It has also been regarded as an important gateway in India’s ‘Act East’ strategy, but progress on infrastructure and projects connecting Mizoram to Myanmar and beyond has been limited. The multi-party contest should raise consciousness of matters related to development as much as those related to ethnic solidarity.

Rajasthan has a history of incumbent governments losing power in the next election. The Congress government in Rajasthan led by Chief Minister Ashok Gehlot is trying to buck that trend, while the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) is relying on it to return to power, and simultaneously effect a change of leadership in the State. Both parties have internal issues to manage even as they face off in a likely straight battle for a majority in the 200-strong State Assembly. Polling is on November 25. To Mr. Gehlot’s credit, he has pulled the Congress up from the trench with a blitzkrieg of new welfare schemes and effective public outreach, blunting anti-incumbency and raising the hope of the cadres. Having averted the default defeat, the Congress’s prospects now depend on how well it selects candidates and gets its campaigning right in the last leg. Younger colleague and aspirant for the top post Sachin Pilot has buried the hatchet and thrown his weight behind Mr. Gehlot in this battle. Reporting so far indicates that while there is no anti-incumbency against the Chief Minister, individual Members of the Legislative Assembly (MLAs) of the Congress might be coming up against strong headwinds. This is a difficult situation for the party to tackle, and replacing the optimal number of sitting MLAs with fresh faces will be a test of Mr. Gehlot’s storied political skills.The BJP has been eager to shake off its dependence on former Chief Minister Vasundhara Raje, an assertive leader who commands her own following that is independent of the party. The central leadership of the party has made it clear that the party will not project a candidate for Chief Minister. Several of her confidantes have been denied ticket already, and more might face the axe. The BJP has fielded seven sitting Members of Parliament among the 41 candidates it has announced, and several of its leaders now nurture ambitions for the top post. Some of them have openly stated that a generational transition in the leadership of the party is underway. The party hopes that this confusion is immaterial in light of the popularity of Prime Minister Narendra Modi, and could even help it. Ms. Raje will look for ways short of an open rebellion to preserve her political standing in the State and the party. Of the five States that are going to the polls next month, the BJP central leadership has the highest stakes in Rajasthan. The outcome in Rajasthan will have the highest influence on its strategy for the Lok Sabha election in 2024 too.

The resurrection of a criminal case dating back to 2010 against writer-activist Arundhati Roy and an academician from Kashmir seems ill-motivated. There can be no other explanation for Delhi Lieutenant Governor V.K. Saxena granting sanction to prosecute Ms. Roy and Sheikh Showkat Hussain, a former Kashmir University professor, for alleged divisive speeches and imputations against national unity made in New Delhi as far back as on October 21, 2010. Coming in the wake of the recent arrest of Prabir Purkayastha, the Editor-in-Chief of NewsClick under an anti-terrorism law and other penal provisions, the revival of a 13-year-old case betrays intolerance and follows a pattern of vendetta against the state’s perceived civil society antagonists and outspoken critics. Significantly, the Delhi Police did not think the speeches merited prosecution for sedition at the time, as sought by a complainant before a Magistrate court. However, a Metropolitan Magistrate rejected the police contention and, on November 27, 2010, directed the filing of a first information report (FIR). The police complied with the order, invoking sections of the Indian Penal Code relating to sedition, statements promoting enmity between different groups, imputations against national integration and statements causing public mischief. The FIR also included Section 13 of the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act (UAPA) which seeks to punish “unlawful activities”.It is known that the government of the day did not wish to pursue any case against remarks made at the conclave titled ‘Azadi: the only way’, as it did not want to jeopardise an ongoing effort to find a political solution to the Kashmir issue through three interlocutors. At a time when much has changed in Kashmir since then, including a spell of elected rule and then the abrogation of Jammu and Kashmir’s special status and its division into two Union Territories, it makes little sense to criminalise past political speeches now. Mr. Saxena has approved prosecution for the other offences, but not sedition, as there is a Supreme Court of India bar on proceeding with sedition charges. It is not clear whether the police will press the UAPA charge, as Section 45 of the Act requires the sanction of the Central government, and the rules prescribe strict time limits to obtain it. It must be examined if the prosecution is barred by limitation. Under the Code of Criminal Procedure, the limitation for offences that entail prison terms of up to three years is three years. All three sections for which sanction has been granted — Sections 153A, 153B and 505 — attract a three-year jail term. Even though the Code permits the exclusion of the period during which sanction is awaited while computing limitation, it is unlikely that courts will permit such an exclusion if the sanction itself was sought after the limitation period.

Madhya Pradesh, which is in the geographical centre of India, will likely witness a straight contest between the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and the Congress in the Assembly election in November. The BJP is currently in power in the State, though it was the Congress that won the election five years ago in 2018. Using defections from the Congress, the BJP usurped power two years later in 2020. The BJP hopes to overcome the anti-incumbency that it has accumulated over 18 years through some deft moves and electoral experiments. The party has given enough indications that Chief Minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan will not continue in the event of the party winning another term; it has fielded seven Parliament members including three Union Ministers — Narendra Singh Tomar, Faggan Singh Kulaste, and Prahlad Singh Patel. The party is betting that it will be able to generate new enthusiasm among its fatigued cadres. The BJP strategy also deemphasises the performance of the State government and Mr. Chouhan and turns the spotlight on the personal image of Prime Minister Narendra Modi. The party’s campaigning focuses on social groups such as tribespeople even as it lays claim to being the sole spokesperson of Hindu identity politics, which manifests itself in acts such as the inauguration of a landmark statue of Adi Shankaracharya recently.The Congress, which is still nursing the wounds of the 2020 split, is trying to turn that setback in its favour in this round. The entry of Congress defectors into its fold unsettled the power balance within the BJP, particularly in the Gwalior-Chambal region, which might translate into electoral dividends for the Congress. The defections also shed some weight from the top for the Congress, helping it to better balance its internal affairs. All leaders now defer to former Chief Minister Kamal Nath who is firmly in command of the party campaign. Congress leader Rahul Gandhi’s Bharat Jodo Yatra had generated enthusiasm in the State, and he now commands a following that adds additional heft for the party. The Congress’s uncharacteristic plunge into caste politics by promising a caste-based survey across the country will be on test in Madhya Pradesh. Unlike Rajasthan and Chhattisgarh, the Congress does not have a considerable number of Other Backward Class leaders in Madhya Pradesh. The party may also have to deal with sniper attacks from the Aam Aadmi Party which may try to alter the bipolar nature of the contest. The biggest challenge for the Congress is to walk a tight rope on the question of Hindu identity politics, and avoid communal polarisation that the BJP instinctively resorts to when on the back foot.

The Goods and Services Tax (GST) Council last Saturday lifted the haze on about a dozen tax treatment ambiguities, some of which have lingered since the indirect tax regime’s launch in July 2017, such as the tax on corporate and personal guarantees for bank loans. It slashed the GST on molasses from 28% to 5%, with a view to lower cattle feed costs and ease up cash flows for sugar mills so they may pay farmers’ dues faster. Rate tweaks and spring-cleaning clarifications apart, one of the significant outcomes was the decision not to exercise the Council’s power to tax extra neutral alcohol (ENA) used for alcoholic liquor. With alcohol for human consumption still outside the GST net, the indirect tax levy on ENA or high strength potable alcohol — a key ingredient — could not be set off against State levies on the final product. Industry had been seeking for clarity on this vexed issue for years, with courts taking varying positions. It is heartening that the Council, that met just twice in 2022, has met four times this year, and thrice in just four months, even if a few agenda items pertained to fixing anomalies in recent decisions. With the age norms for the president and members of the long-awaited GST Appellate Tribunals now harmonised with other tribunals — a clearly avoidable oversight — one hopes they will become operational soon. For consumers and producers, however, the biggest matter of concern should be the Council’s resolve to meet at a future date exclusively to discuss what Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman termed ‘perspective planning’ on the GST Compensation Cess and what kind of surcharge it could be replaced with. Originally packaged as a time-bound levy on top of a ‘Good and Simple Tax’ to compensate States for revenue losses for the first five years of GST, the COVID-19 pandemic’s hit on tax collections had triggered an extension of the Cess levied on so-called demerit goods such as aerated drinks, tobacco products and automobiles, till March 2026. Discouraging some sin goods may be desirable. However, ringing in a new cess must not be done in isolation, but as a part of the broader rationalisation of GST’s complex multiple-rate structure. That rationalisation exercise, initiated two years ago, unfortunately remains off the table despite robust revenue inflows in recent times. Frequent tweaks of irritants aside, the GST regime needs a holistic reform plan, including a road map to bring in excluded items such as electricity, petroleum and alcohol.

There is a tendency to equate elections to the five States of Chhattisgarh, Mizoram, Madhya Pradesh, Rajasthan and Telangana, scheduled for next month, as a “semi-final” before the Lok Sabha polls, but it is wrong to do so as most have populations that rival that of major countries and have specific electoral concerns. What distinguishes this particular cycle of elections is the largely bipolar nature of the contest between the Bharatiya Janata Party and the Indian National Congress in three of them, with regional parties being significant only in Mizoram and Telangana. In all three north-central Indian States with a large Hindi-speaking population, the BJP has sought to cash in on the popularity of the Union government and increased support for its unabashed Hindutva ideology. The Congress seeks to upend this by promising a caste census and focusing on its record of implementing welfare measures, or through a list of committed guarantees. In Rajasthan, Chief Minister Ashok Gehlot remains popular on account of his government’s welfare measures, but his MLAs do not enjoy the same confidence, complicating his party’s task to retain power, even if the scourge of factionalism seems to have been muted for now. In Madhya Pradesh, Chief Minister Shivraj Chouhan has spent 18 years at the helm and faces anti-incumbency over issues related to government performance on the economy and social discrimination, but the fertile ground for Hindutva ideology in the State has provided the BJP a cache of committed voters that has kept it in the fray.In Chhattisgarh, Chief Minister Bhupesh Baghel has managed to stem dissidence within the Congress party and is also seeking to battle on his government’s welfare record — farm loan waivers, increase in support prices for crops and minor forest produce — besides seeking to pander to the voters’ sense of a regional identity. But the BJP again threatens to keep the contest close. A rejuvenated Congress following the Bharat Jodo Yatra and internal elections believes it has the organisational wherewithal to take on the better funded and more resourceful BJP in these three States and its performance could well determine its ability to effectively contest the 2024 polls. In Telangana, the Congress’s revival has been more evident, especially after its triumph in Karnataka. The grand old party now expects to provide a tough fight for the ruling Bharat Rashtra Samithi, with the BJP relegated to the role of a spoiler. The emergence of the Zoram People’s Movement has changed the equations in Mizoram, promising a three-cornered fight in a traditionally two-party system, but Chief Minister Zoramthanga of the ruling Mizo National Front expects the overhang of the Manipur situation and his government’s position to favour his party. These elections are no “semi-finals” but the stakes are high for the two national parties in the fray.

The National Conference (NC)-Congress alliance has pulled off a thumping victory in the Ladakh Autonomous Hill Development Council-Kargil (LAHDC-K) election, blunting the efforts put in by the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) over four years to expand its base in Kargil since it came under the direct rule of the Centre in 2019. This was the first statement made by the Kargil electorate after 2019. Ladakh, comprising Muslim-majority Kargil and Buddhist-majority Leh districts, was granted Union Territory (UT) status, as the Centre decided to end the special constitutional position of the erstwhile State of Jammu and Kashmir (J&K) and split it into two UTs on August 5, 2019. The BJP had won the Ladakh Autonomous Hill Development Council-Leh elections, in 2020. Parties in J&K have called for early elections in the UT too. In Kargil, the NC won 12 seats and the Congress 10, in the 26-member council while the BJP had to be content with two. The election saw a 77.61% turnout, with a significant section of the migrant local population who worked and studied in parts of the country returning to cast their ballot. It is a reflection of how seriously these polls were viewed by the local electorate. Kargil has a total of 74,026 registered voters, spread sparsely in the mountains.In the last four years, Buddhists and Shia Muslims have jointly protested for special status for Ladakh under the Sixth Schedule of the Constitution to protect land, culture, jobs, languages, and environment. Demands for reunification with J&K or full statehood for Ladakh persist. The BJP had hoped to widen its base in Kargil on the basis of its development initiatives, especially the expansion of road works, new educational institutes and reserving lower-rung jobs only for locals. The NC saw these elections as a referendum on the 2019 reorganisation of J&K. Congress leader Rahul Gandhi, who toured Ladakh on a bike for over a week in August this year, became the first senior leader from the party to throw his weight behind the demands of the Kargil Democratic Alliance (KDA), an amalgam of various socio-political-religious groups, for special constitutional guarantees on land and jobs and a separate Lok Sabha seat for Kargil district. At present, Leh and Kargil together form one Lok Sabha seat. The larger message sent by the voters in Kargil to the BJP is that the final status of Ladakh remains an emotive issue. Also, the development push without special protections and constitutional recognition and an elected Assembly may not assuage the sentiments of locals in the region.

The unprecedented surprise attack by Hamas on Israel on Saturday, killing some 700 people, should serve as a reminder of the unsustainability of the situation in the occupied and blockaded Palestinian territories and the dangers that non-state actors such as Hamas pose to Israel, no matter how strong their military and intelligence agencies are. Tensions have been flaring in the West Bank for months, but nobody expected such a coordinated, low-tech yet lethal incursion from Gaza. The West Bank has seen violence on a daily basis in recent months. Before Saturday’s attack, some 200 Palestinians and 30 Israelis were killed this year alone. The Benjamin Netanyahu government largely ignored the violence, and went ahead with its other policy preferences, including the overhaul of the judiciary. The Israeli military described the situation in Gaza as “stable instability”, noting that the situation, though volatile, was under control. And then came the Hamas attack, reminiscent of the 1973 Yom Kippur war when Egypt and Syria shook Israel. Hamas, an Islamist militant organisation that carried out suicide attacks in the 1990s and early 2000s, showed no distinction between civilians and soldiers, dealing the bloodiest blow to Israel in recent history.The attack raises moral and pragmatic questions. Hamas’s indiscriminate violence against Israeli civilians is repugnant and is not going to help the Palestinian cause in any way. On the contrary, it will put more Palestinian lives at risk as Israel, equally disregarding civilian casualties, is pounding the besieged enclave. But at the same time, Palestinian territories, under the yoke of the longest occupation in modern history, have been a fuming volcano. There is no peace process. Israel has continued to build settlements in the West Bank, raising security barriers and checkpoints, limiting Palestinian movements, and never hesitating to use force or collective punishment to keep organised Palestinians under check. This status quo has only turned Palestinians more radical and Hamas even stronger. Israel has now declared war. But past attacks — ground invasions and air strikes — have done little to weaken Hamas. West Asia has also witnessed geopolitical realignments in recent years — from the Israel-Arab reconciliation to the Iran-Saudi détente. But these changes have conveniently sidestepped the occupation of Palestine, West Asia’s original sin, letting the status quo prevail. But the status quo cannot prevail without consequences. If Israel and other regional and international players want lasting peace and stability in the region, their focus must turn to finding a solution to the question of Palestine. The military operations without addressing the core issue would only be cosmetic interventions.

India’s returns of over a hundred medals from the Hangzhou Asian Games is a watershed moment in its sporting history. The momentous achievement has understandably sent the country into a state of euphoria that has even overshadowed the start of the Men’s Cricket World Cup. The 107 medals India clinched (28 gold, 38 silver and 41 bronze) is its best-ever tally, head and shoulders above the previous high of 70 secured at Jakarta 2018. While a lion’s share of the gold medals came from the three disciplines of track and field (six), shooting (seven) and archery (five), India earning podium finishes across 22 different sports points to the nation’s increasing diversification of excellence. The rowers, squash players, kabaddi stars and the men’s hockey team impressed; there was a first-ever gold medal in equestrian; new heroes were found in roller-skating, wind-surfing, wushu and sepaktakraw. Even cricket, which has long lived an insular life away from multi-disciplinary extravaganzas, joined the party, contributing to India’s tally with two golds. This being a visual era, some moments are sure to remain etched in the collective memory, like Parul Chaudhary’s stunning heist in the final 50 metres to win the women’s 5000m and Kishore Jena leading Olympic and World Champion Neeraj Chopra in men’s Javelin before settling for a creditable silver.However, at continental games, harsh as it may sound, some medals are worth more than others. Sports such as badminton and table tennis see near world-level competition in Asia, which adds a bit more lustre to the medals won. Satwiksairaj Rankireddy and Chirag Shetty’s gold in men’s doubles badminton, H.S. Prannoy’s bronze in men’s singles badminton, and Sutirtha and Ayhika Mukherjee’s stunning win over the Chinese world champions in Chen Meng and Wang Yidi in women’s doubles table tennis to ensure a bronze all fall into this category. Additional perspective can be gleaned from the fact that of the 28 golds, only 12 have come in events that are part of the Olympics roster. Even here, just a handful of marks, like Neeraj’s 88.88m throw, are world-beating. This shows that while Indian sport has come a long way, a lot more needs to be done to bridge the gap with global standards. The Union government, Sports Authority of India and various State governments have come up with a plethora of initiatives to help athletes. But they are perennially threatened by inefficient administrators, factionalism in federations, endless court battles and the giant doping cloud that hangs around. For the head to be held high, the body and the legs cannot be allowed to falter.

The FIR registered by the Delhi Police against Prabir Purkayastha, the founder of NewsClick, and others is a vague amalgam of sweeping accusations that do not actually disclose any offence, leave alone one of terrorism. Without citing any published content, the FIR alleges offences that range from hatching a conspiracy to undermine the country’s security to disrupting the 2019 parliamentary polls, from causing disaffection against the government to disrupting essential services. It invokes provisions of the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act (UAPA) and penal provisions relating to conspiracy and promoting enmity between different groups. Quite notably, it does not mention any overt act that may be described as unlawful activity or a terrorist act. There is a general description that foreign funds were infused illegally into India by forces inimical to the country with the objective of causing disaffection against the government, disrupting the sovereignty and territorial integrity of India, and threatening its unity and security. It refers to a ‘conspiracy’ based on purported email exchanges to show Arunachal Pradesh and Kashmir as “not part of India”, and also moves to protract the farmers’ agitation of 2020-21 and thereby disrupt supply of services and other essential supplies.Overall, it is quite clear that the police are combining the remittances by American businessman Neville Roy Singham in NewsClickwith its journalistic content to build a case that “Chinese” funds are being used for propaganda, fomenting unlawful activities, and undermining the country’s security. The UAPA is also conducive to such misuse as its widely defined terms can as easily help criminalise people for ‘thought crimes’ as for their acts. The resort to UAPA is also a tactical aid to prolong the incarceration of dissenters and the disfavoured, and send out a chilling message to the wider media fraternity. There is also the likely electoral spin-off in its potential for the ruling BJP to milk the ‘Chinese conspiracy’ theory in the run-up to the Lok Sabha polls. A related question is whether the alleged creation of shell companies by two telecom companies does not merit more than a casual mention in an unrelated FIR and warrant a separate probe into these conduits for funding terror. In mentioning that a lawyer was among those who helped create a legal network for these companies’ defence, the police seem to be considering criminalising legal services. The case flags a disturbing trend: the present regime’s propensity to misuse anti-terror laws and invoke national security sentiment to undermine individual and media rights.

The decision of the RBI’s Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) to leave interest rates unchanged even as the central bank warned of the major risk that ‘high inflation’ poses to macroeconomic stability is a clear sign that monetary authorities find themselves caught in a cleft stick. After a relatively benign first quarter, when headline retail inflation averaged 4.63% as against the RBI’s projection of 4.6%, price gains measured by the Consumer Price Index (CPI) accelerated sharply in the last quarter with July and August seeing readings of 7.44% and 6.83%, respectively. In a tacit acknowledgment of its misjudgment of inflationary trends, the MPC last week raised its projection for average second-quarter inflation by 20 basis points, from the August forecast of 6.2% to 6.4%. And even this projection appears overly optimistic if one considers that the headline number will need to have slowed drastically to less than 5% in September for the RBI’s prognosis to be validated. For now, the MPC is hoping that the recent reduction in domestic LPG prices combined with a lowering of vegetable prices would provide some near-term respite to price pressures. Governor Shaktikanta Das underlined the RBI’s willingness to resort to Open Market Operation sales of securities to suck out excess funds from the system if it sees reason to believe that liquidity may be rising to a level where it could undermine the overall monetary policy stance.The RBI’s unwillingness to walk the talk and raise interest rates further, even while reiterating the threat to overall economic stability from unmoored inflation expectations, reflects an unstated concern that the growth momentum still remains rather tenuous. The recent debate on the integrity of the NSO’s data on economic growth estimates, and concern that the methodology used to posit 7.8% real GDP growth in the first quarter may have given rise to an overestimation, have to be seen in tandem with economic forecasters’ increased caution over India’s GDP growth outlook for the current fiscal year. Mr. Das acknowledged the weakness in India’s goods exports and the uneven monsoon, which has also led to a drop in kharif sowing of crucial oilseeds and pulses, as key risks to the RBI’s projection for 6.5% GDP growth in FY24. With the rupee already having weakened by about 0.7% since the last policy meeting in August, the RBI also runs the risk of importing inflation and adding to the external sector vulnerabilities if it fails to raise interest rates.

The “surprise” ouster of U.S. House of Representatives Speaker Kevin McCarthy from the top post of the lower chamber of Congress has once again left the Republican Party exposed as a fractured collective. The tenure of Mr. McCarthy, the first ever Speaker in U.S. history to be ejected from the chair, came to an end after Florida Congressman Matt Gaetz invoked a relatively rarely used clause called a “motion to vacate”, which was ironically a concession made by Mr. McCarthy to his Republican opponents to win them over during his arduous campaign to be Speaker in early 2023. The ensuing vote saw Mr. McCarthy, a lawmaker from California, defeated by 216 votes against 210 that supported his continuance as Speaker. Eight Republicans sided with the entire Democratic Caucus of the House to deny Mr. McCarthy his political ambitions in Congress. Particularly vociferous in their resistance to being governed by Mr. McCarthy were members of the Republican Freedom Caucus and their allies, who appeared to resent his cooperation with Democrats on critical policy matters. The most significant among these were bipartisan efforts to avoid a federal government shutdown by raising the debt ceiling. Towards this goal, Mr. McCarthy had signed off on a 45-day temporary spending bill, much to the chagrin of his Republican detractors in the House.Therein lies an indication of the malaise gripping the Republican Party — that there is a vocal faction within the party that sees itself as closely aligned with the political outlook of former President Donald Trump, urging not only for smaller government and lower public expenditure, but also seeking to influence areas of U.S. foreign policy, for example by calling for cuts to U.S. funding to Ukraine in its war efforts against the Russian invasion. This group, described by some as the “GOP radicals”, rejects the notion of compromise, even when it comes at a potentially catastrophic economic cost, such as the shutdown of the government’s critical functions. Indeed, Mr. McCarthy tried to placate this group by denying President Joe Biden his request for $6 billion in support of Ukraine and by announcing a plan to impeach the president on charges related to allegations of wrongdoing by the latter’s son, Hunter Biden, but failed. Ultimately, however, the recalcitrance of this group could prove to be politically costly for the entire party, as 2024 is an election year. This matters especially in the context of independent voters, who often carry the swing votes but would likely walk away from a party that has failed to put its house in order and present a united front at the hustings.

Halfway through the financial year, India’s gross revenues from the Goods and Services Tax (GST) stand at over ₹9.92 lakh crore, marking an 11.1% increase over collections between April and September 2022. The average monthly revenues in 2023-24 are a healthy ₹1,65,418 crore, with four of the six occasions that the GST kitty has crossed ₹1.6 lakh crore occurring in this fiscal. At almost ₹1.63 lakh crore, September’s GST collections were a tad below the average, but 2.3% over August’s inflows that had marked a three-month low. With the festive season kicking in, collections over ₹1.6 lakh crore may persist through this quarter. The government appears comfortably placed regarding GST revenues in the fiscal context, with room to spare for some moderation in inflows during the January-March 2024 quarter when the central bank expects real GDP growth to slow to 5.7% from 7.8% in the first quarter. Beyond the macro resilience that these numbers indicate, a few areas of concern deserve closer scrutiny from policymakers and the GST Council which convenes today.One, there is a discernible slowdown in the growth of GST inflows, which dropped to 10.2% in September, the slowest uptick since July 2021. The average growth between July and September dipped to 10.6% in the second quarter from 11.5% in the first. Growth from domestic transactions and services imports has slowed to 14% over the past two months, from 18% in June. It is important to note that revenues in September, based on transactions undertaken in August, also include pending dues from businesses since the start of the GST regime in 2017-18 as the deadline to remit them was September 30. Moreover, e-invoicing became mandatory for all firms with a turnover of over ₹5 crore since August 1, so there was another compliance push at work. Distilling these effects is necessary to gauge the extent of growth that stemmed from actual consumption and production upticks. That a record 9.34 crore e-way bills generated during August did not translate into the highest-ever revenues may suggest that transaction sizes have shrunk, for instance. Another puzzling trend is seen in revenues from goods imports that have shrunk four times this year. Of course, the lower goods import bills recorded this year will reflect in lower GST intakes. However, imports hit a nine-month high of $58.6 billion in August, 10.75% over July’s import bill. Yet, revenues collected in September were 5.7% below the previousmonth’skitty. This does not add up. Authorities must dig deeper to check for revenue leakages from imports.

The significance of Bihar conducting a caste survey and publishing a caste-wise count of its population is quite immense. The survey, which had all the trappings of a census, complete with a two-stage process of house-listing followed by the eliciting of information from the households, has shown that 63% of Bihar’s 13 crore population belong to castes listed under the Extremely Backward Classes (EBC) and Other Backward Classes (OBC) categories. The socio-economic profiles of the people have also been recorded, but are yet to be revealed. At the national level, it may give a boost to the political demand for a country-wide caste census and push the judicial discourse towards reconsidering the 50% legal ceiling on total reservation in education and government services. In terms of party politics, it may open a new chapter in the traditional conflict between the BJP seeking to consolidate all sections of Hindus into one massive support base and other parties banking on different sections of the OBCs. At a time when Hindutva is seen to have trumped parties that banked on OBC assertion, influential social groups may now sense an opportunity to leverage their size to get their interests advanced by the political class. On the legal side, the numbers may be utilised to present the sort of ‘quantifiable data’ that the judiciary has been asking for to justify the levels of reservation obtaining in various States.Bihar’s exercise marks a precedent on how a caste count should be conducted. The methodology included giving a code to each of the 214 castes in the State’s lists of castes. Sub-castes and sects were identified in advance and subsumed under a broader caste name. This meant that the enumerators could assign a code to any caste name given by a respondent. A major reason for the Union government not releasing the caste-related details of its 2011 ‘Socio-economic and Caste Census’ was that the data it yielded was too confusing and unwieldy. As many as 46 lakh castes were named by the people, presumably because they gave castes, sub-castes, sects, clans, and surnames when asked to name their castes. While there are functional and practical advantages to knowing exact caste numbers, it is not to be forgotten that the larger goal of the Constitution remains the attainment of a casteless society. Affirmative action indeed helps address inequities in society. The state must also look for ways to ensure equality of opportunity and equitable distribution of resources without accentuating caste identity.

Travelling in a bus can be an enjoyable experience if you have your own seat, the vehicle is not crowded, and there is a nice breeze. But if the bus is packed with people, you can get irritable. Something similar happens to atoms: if they are contained in a vessel at a low density, they behave in a certain way, but if they are packed densely together, with little moving space, something new happens. The 2023 Nobel Prize in Chemistry has been awarded to three people who found out what happens. Technically, they have been selected for discovering and refining quantum dots — small crystals a few nanometres wide. Each quantum dot has only a few thousand atoms (whereas a single droplet of water can have a sextillion). And because the atoms are packed so closely together in the dot, their electrons are very close to each other. In this setting, the laws of quantum mechanics describe the behaviour of quantum dots — so much so that an entire dot can mimic the behaviour of an atom. The dots have another famous property. If you shine some light on a quantum dot, it will absorb and re-emit that light at a different frequency (or colour) depending on its size. Smaller dots emit light of higher frequency (bluer) and vice versa. So, a quantum dot made of some material would respond in one way whereas a quantum dot made of the same material but smaller would respond differently. For these reasons, quantum dots have found many applications in transistors, lasers, medical imaging, and quantum computing. In 1981, Alexei Ekimov, then working in the Soviet Union, first synthesised quantum dots ‘frozen’ inside glass. Two years later, Louis Brus synthesised quantum dots in a solution in the U.S., and worked out their quantum-physical properties. Finally, Moungi Bawendi, whose work on quantum dots began as a student under Dr. Brus, found a way to make quantum dots of high quality in an easy and reliable way in 1993. For their contributions, they have shared the Nobel Prize.Some of the most fascinating scientific discoveries, for all their technical sophistication, are actually innocuous in their appeal. Quantum dots are one such. Understanding why they behave the way they do requires specialised knowledge of quantum mechanics, but quantum mechanics do not dictate their behaviour. Dr. Ekimov himself was inspired by the colours in stained glass. While quantum dots light up LED screens and the location of a tumour that needs to be removed, it is important not to lose sight of the colours — the reds, the greens, and the blues — and whatever more they might inspire.

Even for a government that has shown itself to be intolerant of critical journalism, the actions by the Bharatiya Janata Party-led regime on the news website NewsClick smack of extreme vendetta and brazen harassment. The government has, thus far, disclosed no specific allegation on what exactly merited the arrest of the site’s Editor-in-Chief Prabir Purkayastha and another person under the draconian provisions of the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act among others. Reportedly, the website is under investigation for a “terror case with Chinese links”, but no article or content has been brought to light that allegedly suggests any link to “terror” or pro-Chinese propaganda. The news organisation has also said it has not been given a copy of the First Information Report or informed about the particulars of the offences it has been charged with. And yet, the journalists, contributors and employees associated with it have been subjected to raids, with many of their mobile phones and laptops seized. These actions against the website are not new — it has been under the scrutiny of the Enforcement Directorate (ED) and the Income-Tax Department since 2021, with seizures of electronic equipment, but no charge sheet was ever filed against it. The Delhi High Court, finding a prime facie case in favour of NewsClick, granted interim protection to Mr. Purkayastha from arrest and also deterred the ED from taking coercive action against the organisation. A lower court had dismissed a complaint filed by the Income-Tax department on a similar matter.The trigger for the set of actions now is apparently an article in The New York Times that questioned the motives of an investor in NewsClick and alleged his proximity to the Chinese government, but it did not point to any specific article on the site that amounted to illegal propaganda against India. Government representatives first engaged in a systematic vilification and disinformation campaign against the site based on this article. Tuesday’s actions seem driven by an impulse to scapegoat a media outlet and to bring about, therefore, a chilling effect on critical journalism. No government can or should so brazenly target journalists solely based on suspicion about its funding and thereby undermine the freedom of expression, which is guaranteed under the Constitution. Mr. Purkayastha was arrested and kept in jail during the Emergency in 1975 under the draconian Maintenance of Internal Security Act, on trumped up charges, when he was a student-activist at Jawaharlal Nehru University. Today, history seems to be repeating itself, but without even the fig leaf of a declared Emergency.

According to the laws of quantum mechanics, the observable properties of electrons in matter — like a fruit or a rock — change in a few hundred attoseconds. One attosecond is 10-18 seconds. To study these extremely rapid changes, special tools are needed, and Anne L’Huillier, Pierre Agostini, and Ferenc Krausz have received the 2023 physics Nobel Prize for building these tools. From the late 1980s, Dr. L’Huillier led several studies that found that an infrared beam shone on a volume of a noble gas produced multiple overtones: waves whose wavelength was an integer-fraction of the ‘original’ light wave. Her team also observed a peculiar relationship between the original wave’s frequency and the intensity of the overtones, and explained it using the existing laws of quantum mechanics — a milestone. If the overtone waves’ peaks lined up, they would combine to produce a more intense peak (constructive interference); when one wave’s peak coincided with another’s trough, they would cancel themselves out (destructive interference). Physicists realised that this reinforcing effect could be timed such that the gas emitted intense peaks with a pulse duration of a few attoseconds, with destructive interference achieving the cut-off. Dr. Agostini and company demonstrated this in 2001 by producing light with a pulse duration of 250 attoseconds. In the same year, Dr. Krausz and company isolated a single pulse, 650 attoseconds in duration, and used it to measure the kinetic energy of electrons kicked out from krypton atoms by a bunch of photons. Attosecond physics had finally arrived.The medicine Nobel Prize this year celebrated the invention of mRNA vaccines and their effect on the COVID-19 pandemic. The utility for people here was straightforward, whereas that for attosecond physics is not. However, the absence of evidence is not evidence of absence. The specific dynamics of electrons matter in settings with potentially immediate value, including biochemistry, diagnostics, superconductivity, and manufacturing techniques. Thanks to the laureates’ work, scientists have a way to illuminate hitherto unknown possibilities with discoveries of phenomena that live and die in attoseconds. Then again, humans rarely have all the information required to judge whether a particular discovery or invention could be of value later. The 2016 chemistry laureates were feted for building motors with individual molecules — a feat with no known applications at the time, but to achieve it, they devised techniques that improved other areas of chemistry. To paraphrase one of these laureates, J. Fraser Stoddard, there is important value in making something that was hard to do before easier to do today, and “we still have the excitement of finding out what [its applications] might be”.

All nominees for the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine have path-breaking achievements to their credit, but often, the final choice of the winner might have a lot to do with the timing and the context. Katalin Karikó and Drew Weissman would have thus been safe bets for their work that enabled the development of effective mRNA vaccines against COVID-19. The 2023 Nobel announcement comes as no surprise, given that the benefits of the discovery are still keeping people alive and out of hospitals. It also ticks all the boxes: the Nobel prize for Medicine must be awarded for a discovery that would confer the ‘greatest benefit on mankind’ which mRNA undoubtedly did. This Nobel is also significant in that it recognises the contribution of a woman of science: 13 women have now won the Nobel Prize for Medicine (out of 225 awarded); and only 62 women have won any Nobel Prize (against 894 men) so far.The best outcomes inevitably emerge from intersectoral collaborations, and steadfast scientific research conducted against all odds. Hungarian biochemist Katalin Karikó became fascinated with mRNA when it was a mere possibility. In human cells, genetic information encoded in DNA is transferred to messenger RNA (mRNA) and this is then used as a template for protein production. Proteins are the main structural component of cells, and play a key role in growth and repair. During the 1980s, a method called in vitro transcription permitted the idea of using mRNA for vaccine and therapy to take off, but enthusiasm to work on this flagged as several hurdles emerged, including challenges in delivery and inflammatory reactions. Undeterred, Karikó kept on the course of developing methods to use mRNA for therapy, when she was an assistant professor at the University of Pennsylvania. She was then joined by immunologist Weissman, who was studying dendritic cells that have important functions in immune surveillance and activation of vaccine-induced immune responses. Over the years, by making base modifications to the mRNA they managed to ease delivery paths and get rid of the inflammatory reactions. An inchoate idea was finally teased into fruition. This was in 2005, 15 years before the COVID-19 pandemic. But the time and context arrived in 2019, when scientists taught the mRNA vaccine to instruct human cells to make the S protein found on the surface of the COVID-19 virus. This causes the body to create antibodies which will fight the virus if the individual were to contract the infection. The rest, of course, is history.
